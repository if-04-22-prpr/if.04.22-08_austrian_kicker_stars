Introduction</h1>
<p>The implementation of an aggregating application using a Binary Search Tree.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="objective"></a>
Assignment Objective</h1>
<p>Each year one Austria football player is elected as 'Fu√üballer des Jahres'. People can vote for their favorite players. The player that earns the most votes is awarded and also earns honors for the football club he or she is playing for.</p>
<p>This assignment aggregates the awards by player or football clubs to calculate and list players that got the most votes, won the most awards, or clubs that contracted the most players that won awards and so on.</p>
<p>The heart of this assignment is Binary Search Tree (BST), which is used for sorting and indexing aggregated records. Aggregation means, that all kicker-award records that share the same value of one specific property (the aggregation aspect) - such as the name of a player or the name of a club - are combined in a way that accumulates all other properties. Votes are accumulated by adding them, awards are simply counted by the number of appropriate award records (since one record describes the winner of exactly one award) and club names of player name - as the opposite of the aspect - are attached to a list of 'associated texts'.</p>
<p>When a player-award record is added to the tree, the corresponding aggregation record needs to be found. If such an aggregation record exists, the records is aggregated with that aggregation record. Otherwise a new aggregation record is added to the tree in a ordered manner.</p>
<p>The tree can be traversed in various ways and nodes, respectively their payload (the aggregation record), can be visited (e.g. printed). Traversing the tree in the appropriate manner allows to list the aggregations in an ordered way by the aggregation aspect. If, .e.g., award-player records are aggregated by the name of the kickers, a list of all players can easily be printed in alphabethical order.</p>
<p>To produce listing of the aggregated records for other properties, such as votes or number of clubs a kicker played for, the tree need to be reindexed. Reindexing creates a new tree, which is sorted by the wanted property. The source tree is left untouched for this operation.</p>
<p>To support different aggregations, index orders, or visitors, those functionality is provided via function pointer to the according functions of the tree. Using function pointers allows to implement the functions generically regarding orders and aggregation and avoids re-implementing common tree functionality for different indexing or aggregation schemes.</p>

Notes</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>general.h</code> contains macros for finding the minimum, maximum, and absolute value</li>
<li>make cleantest: This new make target for clearing the console, building, and running unit test is available.</li>
<li>Sometimes changes are not properly detected by incremental builds. If something very strange happens during compilation, try to run <code>make clean</code> followed by <code>make</code> to start a clean build. This approach is also recommended after everthing is done, because some compiler warning appears only in clean builds. </li>
